# Covid vs Food Industry 

Who is the audience?
 
The dashboard is targeted toward anyone unemployed, as well as those who lost their businesses. Unfortunately, due to the impact of COVID there is a large unemployed population and many small family run shops have closed down. Specifically, the restaurant and food services industry has been hit very hard and a large % of employees have lost their jobs.
The purpose of this dashboard is to shed light on wages, diversity and occupations within the restaurant and food services industry to help users decide on pursuing or re-entering a career within the industry.


 Which decision is going to be made?

The decision being made by using our dashboard is a strategic decision. Anyone unemployed can make a strategic decision on pursuing a career in the food service industry, or relocate for a better wage within this industry.  Past and future restaurant owners/managers can also strategically decide where is best to open a restaurant based on our analysis of wages by location.  This dashboard can help in making the food service industry more diverse and equalize the gap between races in wages and positions.  Policy makers can use the data and charts to find relationships in income inequality. This may influence strategic decisions in regards to minimum wage increases, assistance of different racial or gender based groups.
 
 
 When is the decision going to be made?

This decision can be made as soon as COVID restrictions are lifted across the nation.  Prior to the restrictions being lifted, this data can help one plan ahead and scope out potential options in the meantime.


Why is it important?

It helps scope out employment/business opportunities for users searching for their most ideal situations.
 

What actions(s) can be taken?

After considering aspects such as the wages per location, wages per position, diversity per position, industry growth, and others a decision can be made to move to a more beneficial location, search for a more desired position, or start oneâ€™s own business in the industry.
